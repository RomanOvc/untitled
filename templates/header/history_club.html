                            The club Association de la Jeunesse Auxerroise was founded in 1905, by the priest Father
                            Ernest
                            Abbé Deschamps. The club success, becoming a force in the Catholic league F.G.S.P.F. In
                            1908,
                            the club even reached the F.G.S.P.F. French Championship final, losing 8–1 however. At the
                            end
                            of the First World War, the club was expelled from its ground. Father Deschamps acquired
                            several
                            pieces of land along the Yonne on the Vaux road, which later formed the Abbé Deschamps
                            Stadium.

                            Auxerre made its first steps in Division 1 on 24 July 1980 against Bastia in Toulon. Auxerre
                            lost the match 2–0. On 20 November 1980, Andrzej Szarmach signed for Auxerre having received
                            consent from the Polish Football Association. He started two days later at home against Lyon
                            and
                            scored the first of his ninety-four goals in Division 1. AJA's first season in Division 1
                            was
                            remarkable for two particular performances: on 13 December 1980, at Parc des Princes against
                            Paris Saint-Germain (3–2), and then on 7 April 1981, at Stade Marcel Saupin against Nantes
                            for a
                            1–0 win, notable as Nantes had not lost a home game for five years and 92 games (between 15
                            April 1976 and 7 April 1981). In the next two seasons, AJA finished fifteenth and eighth
                            respectively.
                        </h6><br>
                        <h6>
                            During the 1983–84 season, AJA climbed for the first time onto the podium in finishing
                            third.
                            Patrice Garande finished top scorer with twenty-one goals. A few weeks later, Garande won
                            the
                            gold medal at the Olympics in Los Angeles with the French Olympic football team while Joël
                            Bats
                            and Jean-Marc Ferreri were part of the victorious French team at UEFA Euro 1984. That
                            summer,
                            Auxerre recruited Michel N'Gom. An international prospect, he left Paris Saint-Germain.
                            During
                            pre-season, he scored five goals in ten games. On the last weekend before the start of the
                            season, he visited his former teammates in Paris. Tragically, he died following a traffic
                            accident on 12 August 1984. To pay tribute, one of the stands at Abbé Deschamps bears his
                            name.
                            The 1984–1985 season saw Auxerre in European competition for the first time in its history
                            by
                            participating in the UEFA Cup, albeit with an unfavourable first round draw with Sporting
                            Clube
                            de Portugal. On 19 September 1984 at Estádio José Alvalade, AJA took its bow in European
                            football with a 2–0 defeat. The return leg took place on 3 October 1984. AJA managed to
                            retrieve
                            the two goal deficit with a double by Szarmach, but eventually succumbed with two goals in
                            extra
                            time. However, by virtue of the victory of Monaco in the Coupe de France, AJA also qualified
                            for
                            the UEFA Cup the year after.

                        <h6>
                            The 1985 offseason saw Joël Bats join Paris Saint-Germain. Auxerre recruited Bruno Martini
                            as
                            his successor. In the UEFA Cup, AJA were drawn against Milan. In the first leg, Auxerre won
                            3–1.
                            Both teams missed a penalty and Paolo Maldini made his debut in European competition. In the
                            return match, AJA lost 3–0 and was therefore eliminated. Seventh in the league and
                            quarter-finalist in the French cup, AJA did not manage a third straight season in Europe.
                            Auxerre finished fourth in 1986–1987, and was once again eliminated in the first round of
                            the
                            UEFA Cup the following season with a 2–0 away defeat to Panathinaikos too much to overcome
                            in
                            the return leg (which Auxerre won 3–2). The 1988–89 season saw AJA finish fifth in the
                            league
                            and reach the semi-finals of the Coupe de France before elimination by Olympique de
                            Marseille,
                            the future winner of the event. With fifth place in the league, AJA made the UEFA Cup and
                            there
                            made its first decent run. During the preliminary round, AJA managed its first victory.
                            Beaten
                            0–1 at home by Dinamo Zagreb, it registered 3–1 in Yugoslavia and qualified for the first
                            round
                            proper. Auxerre beat successively Albanians Apolonia Fier, Finns RoPS and Olympiacos of
                            Greece
                            before being eliminated in the quarterfinals by Fiorentina. In parallel with this, AJA
                            managed
                            sixth place in the league. During the summer of 1990, the AJA sold Basile Boli and recruited
                            Enzo Scifo, Alain Roche and Zbigniew Kaczmarek. Auxerre finished in third place after
                            leading
                            the championship for two weeks.

                            In 1991–92, Auxerre was eliminated in the second round of the UEFA Cup by Liverpool and then
                            finished fourth in Division 1. That summer, the AJA sold Alain Roche and Jean-Marc Ferreri
                            while
                            recruiting Frank Verlaat and Gerald Baticle. Auxerre then journeyed again into UEFA. Auxerre
                            eliminated Lokomotiv Plovdiv and the newly formed F.C. Copenhagen. In the third round, AJA
                            eliminated Standard Liege. In the quarterfinals, AJA faced Ajax, the defending champion and
                            undefeated in the European Cup for two years. Before facing Ajax, Auxerre had suffered five
                            consecutive league defeats. Auxerre managed a 4–2 home win. In the second leg Ajax could
                            only
                            manage a 1–0 win and so Auxerre had qualified for the semifinals, to face Borussia Dortmund.
                            In
                            the first leg in Germany, AJA lost 2–0. A fiercely contested second leg levelled the
                            aggregate
                            score, but Auxerre were finally eliminated on penalties.

                            While finishing sixth in the championship, Auxerre again qualified for the UEFA Cup after
                            the
                            VA-OM case. But unlike the epic run of the previous season, AJA was eliminated in the first
                            round by Tenerife. AJA made progress in the league, with a third-place finish, but notably
                            captured its first major trophy, the French cup. Having made it past the lower division
                            teams in
                            the early rounds, AJA eliminated Nantes in the semifinals before winning 3 goals to 0 at
                            Parc
                            des Princes in the final against Montpellier. The following season, Auxerre finished fourth
                            in
                            the league and was a quarter-finalist of the Cup Winners' Cup: Auxerre was eliminated by
                            Arsenal
                            in the Abbe-Deschamps (1–0) having achieved a 1–1 draw at Highbury.

                            During the 1995-96 season, the club won Division 1 for the first time in their history, and
                            also
                            won the Coupe de France.

                            On 13 May 2012, Auxerre's 32-year stay in the top division came to an end after a 3–0 away
                            defeat at the hands of Marseille. The following season, Auxerre finished a disappointing
                            ninth
                            place along with a goal difference of −2. The next season was no better for AJA, after they
                            finished a lowly 16th position. Although not resulting in promotion the 2014–15 Ligue 2
                            season
                            was better for the Burgundy based side as they finished ninth in Ligue 2 and finishing
                            runners-up in the 2015 Coupe de France Final after losing to Paris Saint-Germain at the
                            Stade de
                            France in front of an attendance of 80,000. The 2018-19 season is Auxerre's seventh
                            consecutive
                            in the Ligue 2.</h6><br>
